# Avengers Social Network
This repository contains the final project for the *Server-side JavaScript* course taken during the last year of the CS bachelor at the Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics of the University of Bucharest.<br>

Built by: [@andreihodoroaga](https://github.com/andreihodoroaga) and [@tudorcoman](https://github.com/tudorcoman).

The project serves as the backend for a social network, implemented with **NodeJS**, **GraphQL**, and **SQLite**. <br><br>Users can create posts, engage with other posts through replies and reactions, as well as create and participate in events. To add a touch of nostalgia, users can also "poke" each other.

## Demo
You can explore some of the possible GraphQL queries and mutations in the [flows folder](/flows), such as:

- Create, reply to, and react to posts
- Create and participate in different events
- Follow and poke users
- Bookmark your favorite posts
- Customize your profile with a picture and bio

## Running the project

1. Install dependencies using `npm i`.
